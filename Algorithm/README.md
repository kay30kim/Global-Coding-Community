# Algorithm Study Plan (2024)

This document outlines the study plan for the upcoming algorithm study sessions, focusing on core data structures and algorithms concepts. Each week, we will delve into a specific topic, gradually building up a comprehensive understanding of key concepts.

## Weekly Schedule

### 1st Week: 2024.09.26 - 2024.10.02
#### Topic: Binary Tree
- Binary Tree is a hierarchical structure with nodes, each having at most two children: left and right.
- Key concepts include traversal techniques (in-order, pre-order, post-order), depth, and balanced trees.

### 2nd Week: 2024.10.03 - 2024.10.09
#### Topic: Dynamic Programming
- Dynamic Programming (DP) is an optimization technique used to solve complex problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems. DP is particularly effective in solving problems that exhibit overlapping subproblems and optimal substructure properties.

### 3rd Week: 2024.10.10 - 2024.10.16
#### Topic: Linked List
- A Linked List is a linear data structure where elements are not stored in contiguous memory locations. Each element (node) points to the next, allowing dynamic memory allocation. Linked lists are fundamental for building complex data structures like stacks, queues, and graphs.

## Concepts Covered

The study sessions will cover a wide range of data structures and algorithms, each fundamental for solving various types of computational problems.

| Concept              | Description                                                                 | Frequency |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|
| **Array**            | A collection of elements identified by index, commonly used for storing data contiguously in memory. | 24        |
| **Binary**           | Refers to binary representations and operations on binary numbers (0s and 1s). | 7         |
| **Binary Search**    | An efficient search algorithm that operates on sorted arrays, halving the search space with each step. | 8         |
| **Binary Search Tree** | A binary tree structure where each node's left subtree contains values less than the node, and the right subtree contains values greater than the node. | 5         |
| **Binary Tree**      | A tree data structure where each node has at most two children, commonly used for hierarchical data representation. | 18        |
| **Dynamic Programming** | A method for solving complex problems by breaking them down into simpler overlapping subproblems, often using a recursive or iterative approach. | 12        |
| **Graph**            | A collection of nodes connected by edges, used to model relationships between pairs of objects. Graphs can be directed or undirected. | 21        |
| **Hash Table**       | A data structure that implements an associative array, mapping keys to values for fast lookups. | 3         |
| **Heap**             | A specialized tree-based data structure that satisfies the heap property, commonly used in priority queues. | 8         |
| **Linked List**      | A linear data structure where elements are stored as nodes, with each node pointing to the next. | 14        |
| **Math**             | Algorithms and concepts related to arithmetic, geometry, and other mathematical principles used in problem-solving. | 5         |
| **Matrix**           | A two-dimensional array of elements, commonly used to represent grids and perform operations in computational problems. | 5         |
| **Queue**            | A linear data structure following the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle, used in scheduling and buffering. | 1         |
| **Recursion**        | A problem-solving technique where a function calls itself to break down problems into smaller instances of the same problem. | 6         |
| **Stack**            | A linear data structure following the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle, used in parsing and backtracking algorithms. | 14        |
| **String**           | A sequence of characters used to represent text, often manipulated using algorithms for pattern matching, searching, and parsing. | 14        |
| **Trie**             | A tree-like data structure used to store dynamic sets or associative arrays, commonly used for prefix-based searches. | 4         |

Each week will focus on mastering one of these core concepts, with practice problems and discussions tailored to develop both theoretical understanding and practical skills.

**Let’s build a strong foundation in algorithms together!**

## How to Participate

- Each participant studies the assigned topic independently and practices by solving problems on platforms like **LeetCode**, **NeetCode**, or **Grind 75** to build their skills.
- At the scheduled meeting time each week, we will select a **random problem** and solve it together.
- During the session, we will allocate **20 minutes to solve the problem**, followed by a discussion where participants share their solutions and code review.
- By actively solving problems and engaging in discussions, participants can solidify their understanding of the concepts and learn from each other's approaches.

**Let’s prepare efficiently and grow together!**
